hi! i'm uku, a 18 year old engineering student who loves to mod games (especially Minecraft) and tinker around in my free time.

i don't do much stuff outside of coding and playing videogames, so check out the links below if you're interested in either of those things!

i sometimes _(rarely)_ write blog posts about stuff i find interesting (or not), which you can check out [here](/posts)!
